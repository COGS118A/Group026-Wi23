    "Natural language processing (NLP) has been making headlines all over the news in recent months due to the release and gaining popularity of ChatGPT (chatbot developed by OpenAI).\n",
    "To take a closer look at the field of NLP, we plan to implement a sentiment analysis, a NLP technique that is used to determine the text attitude on a scale from -1 to 1 where absolute positive input has score 1, absolute negative input has score of -1, and a score of 0 is for neutral sentiment.\n",
    "In this project we examine how general a sentiment analysis tool can be \n",
    "(e.g. when trained on data on a specific topic how well it can perform on other topics that it didn’t encounter before or general topicless data) \n",

    "In previous studies, the generalisability and interoperability of NLP models in tasks such as fake news detection<a name=\"fakenews\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#fakenews)<a name=\"fakenews2\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#fakenews2), hate speech detection<a name=\"hatespeech\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#hatespeech), and sentiment analysis<a name=\"sentian\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#sentian) were explored. It was found that generalisability is a challenge for NLP algorithms, as they generalize poorly on new and unseen datasets<a name=\"fakenews\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#fakenews). However, robust NLP models are desired to perform large-scale, cross-categorical classification tasks on the internet or social media platforms. Some studies suggest that the biases found in models may due to the small datasets the models are trained on, which make the models prone to overfitting issues<a name=\"fakenews\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#fakenews). Larger and more diverse datasets are required to reduce biases in trained models. It was suggested that cross-dataset testing is a useful tool to evaluate model generalisability performance realistically<a name=\"hatespeech\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#hatespeech). Due to such reasons, our project is motivated to explore the generalisability of NLP sentiment analysis models on different datasets pertaining to different subject matter.\n"

Also, in each approach, different classifiers are evaluated and tested against our metrics and we will select the best model in each approach. For approaches 1 and 2, we are looking at supervised machine learning methods for the classifiers.

    "Due to the datasets all coming from real people collected through social media, there are ethical concerns over their consent in being part of this project as points of data, even with their words and personal information accessible through the media the data is extracted from (Twitter and Reddit).\n",
    "Proper data cleaning and handling would require giving those people as much anonymity that is possible to be given, such as removing their usernames/handles and even the permalink/id to avoid being traced back to a user or community.\n",

    "The goal of this project is to see if, given the labels already assigned in some datasets, how well can a model be trained on them to label other datasets?\n",
    "As the data comes from a sample of people in the population of those respective media for certain topics, the text content may be biased towards/against certain topics or communities.\n",
    "Some datasets have already included sentiment labels to indicate if they are positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "Using this data in training may contribute to the model’s perceived connotation of those and related texts in unlabeled datasets.\n",
    "Conclusions drawn from those results may be harmful to a degree regardless of actual intent or content because of the nature of applying sentiment analysis.\n",
    "This project and those that are working with it do not show any personal support or opposition for any of the data gathered, and to keep the integrity of the project itself, all usable content (those in the English language) can be used without censorship as to not influence the direction of the model toward our personal preferences.\n"
